Cyclery was my initial experience and exploration into circular knitting. I created a small, functional line of cycling oriented sleeveless hoodies by making the back of the hoodie longer so it would not ride up while cycling. 

This was my first experience designing to the constraints of a jacquard knitting machine using only four colors in a bitmap, 1 pixel = 1 stitch process. These files were created in Lectra Kaledo design software. Here I fell in love with the combination of technical and aesthetic aspects, accounting for shrinkage (sort of), the multiple colors and textures that could be created with just four colors and how there is freedom within constraint.
