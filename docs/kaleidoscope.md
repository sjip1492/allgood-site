To develop Kaleidoscope I started by compiling a blanket of textures where each feed in the face of the fabric was striped, so each line alternated colors . This meant a total of four colors constantly striping in the face that could be suppressed by allocating which yarns were coming up in the even and odd lines. This is illustrated in the close ups of both the fabrics and knit files. 

By creating different textures, the fabric gives the illusion of many different colors and shades depending on the yarns used.

In this development I found it was best to use a scale of colors from light, medium-light, medium-dark and dark. This created the greatest range and variance in color options.
