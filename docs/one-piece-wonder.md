White designing in the Shima Seiki Wholegarment program there were many settings for sweaters and leggings but there was nothing for a one piece garment. As my design began to take shape I took inspiration from superheroes and their single piece outfits. I was drawn to the brightly colored yarn in our studio and thought, wouldn’t it be funny if this superhero looked like they were in pajamas. And what kind of superhero would be in pajamas? One that wasn’t always “on top of their game” or was quite quirky. This is where my reference to the underwhelming superhero Hancock inspired me as well as the brightness and quirkiness of Harley Quinn. Someone powerful, but kind of a mess.
