Exodus Unseen was my senior capstone project. I explored and sought to grapple with something I had no context or experience with which was the refugee crisis. I had no previous grasp of a world at war and the displaced people in it. I was uncertain of how to broach something so large that I was not an expert on. So I decided to create something that represented my experience of researching and learning about something new which evoked a great deal of uncertainty and pain in me. Especially through listening to refugees testimonies of their trials and experiences. And I tried to figure out how to condense and capture a darkness that was not my own.
