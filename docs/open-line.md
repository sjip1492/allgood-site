I created this booklet for my company’s open line collection to hand out at trade shows. Using InDesign I compiled photographs, trend images and 3D renderings into a layout for customers to get a taste of our upcoming season’s knits. We created multiple lines including Bazaar, a collection based around world cultures and motifs with a more ornate hand-made touch. As well as Modern Memphis, our interpretation of the 1980s Memphis Movement through signature black on white with graphic patterns. 

The pages featured here are my fabric contributions to our open line. My coworker and I worked in collaboration to create the 3D renderings of our fabrics.
