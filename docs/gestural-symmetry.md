This garment was a juried submission for North Carolina Museum of Art’s celebration of College Night for college students to get a first look of the museum’s exclusive M.C. Escher exhibition. I partnered with fellow classmate Eleanor Yeh in order to create this garment. We were struck by the flowing and optically misleading nature of many of Escher’s pieces. So we took inspiration for the unique and optically illusive Tamoko Nakamichi’s Pattern Magic book in order to create the disappearing tie and double sided skort. 

I developed the textile design initially with pen and ink on paper, then scanned them into the computer and used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to place them onto the pattern pieces Eleanor developed. We worked in combination to determine how to place the engineered panels in order to print and have the textile designs align correctly once sewn together.
